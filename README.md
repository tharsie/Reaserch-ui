## 📌 Project Overview
Paddy farming in Sri Lanka faces multiple challenges such as pest attacks, improper fertilizer application, high cultivation costs, and unstable market price fluctuations. Farmers and agricultural officers often make decisions without accurate data-driven insights, resulting in yield loss, increased cost, and environmental damage due to chemical misuse.

This project proposes an **AI-Driven Decision Support System** as a **web-based application** that integrates multiple intelligent prediction and recommendation modules to optimize sustainable paddy farming. The system provides actionable insights using machine learning and visual dashboards to support decision-making for farmers, Agricultural Department officers, and Agri Business Centers.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Predict pest attack risks using IoT + weather data.
- Provide intelligent fertilizer recommendations and expected yield forecasting.
- Estimate cultivation cost for improved budgeting.
- Forecast paddy price and demand trends for market planning.
- Provide a unified dashboard for decision support with visual insights.

## 🧩 System Modules
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pest Attack Prediction** | Predicts pest risks using environmental conditions and sensor data. |
| **Intelligent Fertilizer Recommendation & Yield Prediction** | Recommends top fertilizers and forecasts expected yield using ML models. |
| **Cultivation Cost Estimation** | Estimates total cost based on inputs, labor, transport, and operational factors. |
| **Paddy Price & Demand Forecasting** | Predicts price and demand trends using time-series forecasting and sentiment analysis. |

## 🔄 High-Level Workflow
1. User logs into the web application.
2. Selects a module (Pest / Fertilizer & Yield / Cost / Price & Demand).
3. Inputs data via manual input form or IoT sensor mode (where available).
4. Data is preprocessed and passed through trained machine learning models.
5. Output predictions and recommendations are visualized in the dashboard.
6. Reports and predictions can be saved for tracking and future analysis.
